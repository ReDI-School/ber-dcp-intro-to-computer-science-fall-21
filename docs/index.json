If a user has the following permissions, they can:  Read: view the contents of the file Write: modify the contents of the file Execute: run the program (remember: programs are also treated as \u0026quot;files\u0026quot; in Linux systems and are permissioned using the same terms!)    Navigate file system and working with files \u0026amp; folders (demo) | 10-15 minutes Why use the command line?  once familiar with it, faster and easier to navigate the file system offers many powerful tools (especially, but not limited to, text and file manipulation) possible to group together commands and automate repeatable workflows helpful (often required) when working on virtual machines or infrastructure in the cloud  Demo Let's go through how to navigate the file system and work with files and folders. We will do this both via the command line using the commands listed in the cheat sheet below and then using the GUI (Graphical User Interface). Please refer to this cheat sheet when working through the exercises in groups later!\nCommand Line cheat sheet Remember that you can look up what a command does by using the man (manual-pages) command on Mac and Linux, or help command on Windows cmd. For example: man echo would give you information on what the echo command does and how to use it.     command what it does     pwd print working directory (print the path to where I currently am in the file system)   cd change directory (this moves you, the viewer of the terminal, to a new location in the file system). You may use an absolute file path or a relative path where . is the current working directory and .. is the parent directory.   ls list the contents of the directory   mkdir make a directory   touch create a new file   rm delete a file (note: to delete a directory, add the option -r or -d)   cp copy a file (note: to copy a directory you probably need to add an option (like -r))   mv move a file or directory to a new location (note: this can also be useful for changing the name of a file/directory)   echo print some text; often used in conjunction with other commands   cat print the contents of the file   \u0026gt; this is an operator: X \u0026gt; Y will redirect (send) the outputs of command X to Y; if Y exists, it this will overwrite the existing file.   \u0026gt;\u0026gt; this is an operator similar to the above: X \u0026gt;\u0026gt; Y will send the outputs of command X to Y; if Y exists, it this will append to the existing file.    Quick overview of package managers  Packages are collections of files that are bundled together and can be installed and removed as a group\nPackage managers allow you to:\n keep track of what software is installed easily install new software upgrade existing software to newer versions remove or uninstall software.  There are different package managers available for different Operating Systems and Distributions. Here are some examples:\n  MacOS: homebrew, AppStore\n  Windows: PackageManagement, Chocalatey...\n   Linux: yum, apt-get, zypper\n   Tasks for group work Work through the tasks with your partner/group. We recommend that one of you shares your screen and you discuss as a group how to proceed with each of the tasks. Each group member should be following along. It is totally fine if you don't complete all the tasks; make sure you understand how to do each task and ask questions if anything does not make sense! Complete any remaining tasks for homework.\n0. Open a terminal window Open a terminal window or Repl, where you can practice using the command line.\nOn Mac, you can do this by searching for \u0026quot;Terminal\u0026quot; in your Applications folder or using the keyboard shortcut \u0026quot;Command + Space\u0026quot; and then typing in \u0026quot;Terminal\u0026quot;.\nOn Windows, open Cmder if you installed this as part of the prerequisites, or if you installed the Linux subsystem for windows, you can run WSL or follow the instructions described in the video. Alternatively, you can use Cygwin or the gitbash shell to practice Linux commands, or if nothing is available or working on your machine, please use Repl for today.\nIf you are running into any challenges with this, reach out to one of the teachers.\n1. Move to the parent directory and back  Print your working directory Move into the parent directory, if there is one. Move back into the directory you came from.  Hint: if your original working directory path looked something like folder1/folder2/folder3, then for this task, you want to move to folder1/folder2 and then back to folder1/folder2/folder3.\n2. Create a redi folder Let's create a folder to store the work from this session.\n Navigate to the place where you would like this folder to be located. The current working directory is fine, but you can also navigate to your desktop or another folder where you keep course work. Create a new directory (folder) titled redi-2021-09-16 Move into this new directory and print your working directory. Double check that your working directory now includes redi-2021-09-16.  3. Create some files Now let's create some files to go in this new directory.\n  Create an empty file called \u0026quot;test1.txt\u0026quot; using the touch command.\n  Create a second file called \u0026quot;hello.txt\u0026quot; which contains the phrase: \u0026quot;hello, my name is YOUR_NAME_HERE!\u0026quot;. (Replace YOUR_NAME_HERE with your name :)) Hint: use the echo command and the \u0026gt; operator to do this.\n  List the files that are in the directory, and make sure that it looks something like:\n1test1.txt hello.txt   Append the line \u0026quot;How are you doing?\u0026quot; to the file \u0026quot;hello.txt\u0026quot;\n  Print the contents of the file and make sure that it looks something like:\n1hello! my name is YOUR_NAME_HERE! 2How are you doing?   4. Move these files into a new directory Let's organize the directory that we are in by putting some of the files in a new location.\n Create a folder (directory) called test-files in the redi-2021-09-16 folder List the contents of the directory that you are in and make sure that it looks something like: 1test1.txt hello.txt test-files  Move test1.txt into the test-files directory. List the contents of test-files and make sure it contains only test1.txt, and list the contents of redi-2021-09-16 to confirm that test1.txt has been moved.  5. Copy files and directories  Copy of hello.txt into the test-files directory. (Hint: this can be done in one command by copying the file to the proper location, or by creating a copy and then moving the file.) Rename the original hello.txt to original-hello.txt. (Hint: \u0026quot;renaming\u0026quot; is the same as moving a file to a new file path.) Make a copy of the test-files directory named test-files-copy. List the contents of test-files-copy and make sure that it contains both test1.txt and original-hello.txt.  6. Delete files and directories Be careful with this one! Please double check the command with one of the teachers before removing anything, since anything removed via rm cannot be retrieved!!\n In the test-files-copy, delete the test1.txt file. Confirm that test-files-copy contains only original-hello.txt. Delete the entire test-files-copy directory. List the contents of the redi-2021-09-16 directory and make sure that the test-files-copy directory is gone, but that the original test-files directory and other files are still present.  (Optional) 7. Additional Practice These are additional challenge tasks that are meant to be extra challenging, in case the previous tasks went by more quickly than expected! :)\n Use the man-pages and Google to understand how to use the grep command. Use this command to search for occurrences of the text \u0026quot;my name is\u0026quot; in the redi-2021-09-16 directory. (Hint: you can use the -r option to do this) Create a journal/diary as a group with the following structure: the journal folder should contain year folders on the first level. Within a year folder are month folders, which contain text files for each individual day. A file path for one of these may look like: .../journal/2021/09/16.txt. Create a few entries that have some text!

Create a local repository First, create a new directory and give it the same name as your GitHub username (the reason for this will become clear later):\n1mkdir \u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt; Move into that directory\n1cd \u0026lt;github-username\u0026gt; Initialise an empty git repository with the branch name, main:\n1git init -b main Now you have an empty local repository üéâ\n2. Make a commit Next, we want to make changes within this repository and save (or commit!) them.\nA commit is a way to save changes you‚Äôve made to a repository. It is powerful because it allows you to keep snapshots of your repository at any given time.\nFirst, we create a new file:\n1touch README.md This is a README file using markdown syntax.\nNext, we will add some text to this file to say hello to the world.\n1echo \u0026#34;# Hello, my name is \u0026lt;your name\u0026gt; :)\u0026#34; \u0026gt; README.md Then view the status of the current git repository:\n1git status The README.md file will appear in the untracked files. We want to track this file and add it to the staging area so it will be included in the next commit:\n1git add . Then check the status again.\nLet's commit this file with a helpful commit message:\n1git commit -m \u0026#34;Initialise repository with a README\u0026#34; Finally, we can take a look at the log, to view metadata about our previous commits:\n1git log 3. Create a remote repository (on GitHub) Sign in to GitHub: https://github.com\nOn the top navigation bar, click the + button and select ‚ÄòNew repository‚Äô\nCreate a new repository: Give the repository the same name as your username, make sure it is ‚ÄòPublic‚Äô then click ‚ÄòCreate repository‚Äô.\n4. Push the contents of your local repository to the remote Now we want to associate our local repository with the one we have created on GitHub and push the contents of our local repository to GitHub.\nConnect the local repository with the remote repository:\n1git remote add origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;.git Verify that the remote was added:\n1git remote -v You should see the following output:\n1origin\thttps://github.com/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;.git (fetch) 2origin\thttps://github.com/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;.git (push) Finally push your changes to GitHub:\n1git push -u origin main Check your GitHub repository to see if it contains your README file, and look at your profile to see that it is displayed!\nWell done on sharing your first repository üéâ\n5. Create a branch Now we want to make some changes to our README, but we don't want to commit them to the main branch yet. Therefore, we will use another branch.\nCreate a new branch, called ‚Äòadd-more-detail‚Äô:\n1git checkout -b add-more-detail Open the README.md file in a text editor (e.g. Notepad or TextEdit) and make some changes. Here is a template you can use:\n1# Hello, my name is \u0026lt;your name\u0026gt; üëã 2 3Pronouns: \u0026lt;your pronouns\u0026gt; 4Learning: command line, Git, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python 5Interests: \u0026lt;your interests\u0026gt; You can be as creative as you want by adding text, emoji, images or gifs (and more!).\nOnce you have made some changes it is time to add and commit them:\n1git add . 2git commit -m \u0026#34;Add some new information\u0026#34; Then push the branch with the changes to the remote repository:\n1git push origin add-more-detail Take a look at your README profile - has it been updated?\n6. Create a pull request Let's say we want to get feedback on the changes we've made. We can do this with a Pull Request.\nGo to GitHub and view your branch. Select 'Create new pull request'.\nAssign the person you are paired with to review your pull request.\nReviewing a pull request If somebody has requested your feedback, you can use this as an opportunity to:\n Ask questions and provide feedback about the changes Approve the changes Request further changes  Once you have reviewed the changes, click Review changes and then Approve.\nMerge a pull request Once your pull request has been reviewed, you can merge it so that the main branch is updated with your changes.\nOn your pull request, go to the bottom of the page and select Rebase and merge.\nYou can now go to your command line, checkout the main branch and pull the changes so that your local main branch is up to date:\n1git checkout main 2git pull origin main Finally, take a look at your updated GitHub profile README and celebrate what you've achieved!\n7. Fork and clone a repository Note üìù\nThis task is unrelated to the previous tasks, but has been included because these features are useful.\nA fork is a copy of someone else‚Äôs remote repository, sometimes you will make a fork to build on someone else's work.\nNavigate to https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife\nOn the top-right, select 'Fork'.\nOnce you have forked the repository, we can clone it to download a copy of the repository to your local machine. On the repository, select Code and copy the HTTPS link. Then navigate to your terminal and run:\n1git clone https://github.com/\u0026lt;user\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo\u0026gt;.git 8.
